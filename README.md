### StringNumberRepresentation

Write a function that accepts an integer and returns the English string representation of that integer.
The input is limited to non-negative integers. Your interviewer will tell you the set of possible integers.

Example:
3 -> three
33 -> thirty three
333 -> three hundred thirty three

Note the absence of connective words like 'and'. The test cases use lower case words for string matching! Good Luck!
